***********************
Unicore-II Simulator is a application level simulator of the architecture of Unicore-II, which is based on MIPs. The simulator contains the simulation of the followings:
a. A CPU with five(or seven)-level pipeline.
b. An I-cache and a D-cache.
c. Simple memory management, a stack is at least involved.
d. Simple I/O support.

Then, the following function is involved:
a. Statistical functions, including CPU occupancy rate, total running time, cache missing rate, branch prediction missing and so on (to be added)
b. A debugger is supported. That is, a program can be run in trap mode.
c. The execuation file fomart is Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), which follows the strict decipline published by UNIX System Laboratories (USL) as part of the Application Binary Interface (ABI).
d. File operation is supported.

Besides, a simulator for compilation file is also implemented for test of validation.
